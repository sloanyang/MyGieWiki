This is done via the ''page properties'' dialog which looks a lot like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;&lt;tiddler PageProperties&gt;&gt;
The data is:
* ''Title &amp; Subtitle''&lt;br&gt;What is displayed at the top of the page and in the SiteMap, etc.
* ''Owner''&lt;br&gt;Who controls the properties of this page. This would be your PenName, which initially is the same as your login name, but you can change it via the UserProfile.
* ''Groups''&lt;br&gt;You may define a group (or multiple groups) of people that should have elevated access to the page.
* ''Access permissions''&lt;br&gt;The level of access that various user classes should have to this page.
* ''Includes''&lt;br&gt;Shows any resources that you include into this page - not edited directly, but rather via the ImportTiddlers feature.
* ''Read-only view options''&lt;br&gt;Various aspects of how the page looks to someone who does not have edit access.

The page properties dialog is normally accessed via the edit menu, but for a page with no data, it opens automatically.&lt;br&gt;
The login dialog is usually accessed via the button at the top of the toolset on the right.
