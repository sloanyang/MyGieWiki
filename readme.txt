This is (or was) giewiki release 1.15.6.

Starting point:
	http://giewiki.appspot.com (or readme.htm, if present)
 
New features in release 1.15:
	* Site-wide tag links, retrieved via the 'tags' caption.
	* User-defined template for the auto-generated mails.
	* New option to Auto-save changes while editing.
	* Allow custom revision history via the ViewTemplate.
	* On demand-loading macro's assuming tiddler title = '<macro-name> macro'.
	* Lazy-load tiddler attribute for generel load-on-demand.
	* "requires" attribute for systemConfig tiddlers.
	* Admin now has direct DataStore link to http://appengine.google.com.
	* NoAccessMessage, a special tiddler, which prompts the user to log in if he doesn't have (anonymous) read-access to the page. 
	  It's therefore listed in stead of the defined DefaultTiddlers in such case.

Fixed in 1.15.2:
	* missing index data in config.js
	* sorting of index.xml: Now most recent
